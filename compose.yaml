# docker compose -- helps us remember various arguments on the actual docker commands
#                -- helps manage 1+ container at a time for the local project
#                -- defined by a flexible yaml-like file of key-value pairs

# Run all configurations: docker compose up --build
# Run a new instance of a container: docker compose run app /bin/bash

# docker compose expects services, has to be the first key-value pair defined
services:
  # key-values for the names we want to call our services
  static_html: # custom key name, could even be "my_awesome_app"
    # set argument names for Docker custom apps, cannot be customized
    # Example argument: "image: python:3.13.4-slim-bullseye"

    # Building a custom Docker container instead
    build:
      # where are we building the Dockerfile
      # often easier to consolidate with the app you're running
      context: ./static_html
      # location of file
      dockerfile: static.Dockerfile

    # map ports available to local machine / container
    ports:
      - 8000:8000
      - 3000:8000
    command: python -m http.server 8000

    # mount a local directory to a container, kinda like attaching an external drive
    # static way to make changes with static files. cool!
    # note that sometimes you need to update the web framework command to update based on file changes
    volumes:
      # {local folder relative to compose.yaml file}:{location in docker container of the same folder you copied into}
      # this volume is not managed by Docker, but sometimes there can be cruft. To clean up: docker compose down -v
      - ./static_html/src:/app

  # you can then build other services and set out other configurations below, typically 1:1 between service to folder
  backend:
    build:
      context: ./backend
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - 8080:8000

    # now running a FastAPI web app
    # uvicorn := webserver interface for asynchronous programs
    # --host : bind it to any host by setting all to 0, can be accessed by any host that's running it
    # --reload : watching for file changes in the volume (or can run action:restart below)
    command: uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

    # setting environment variables
    # not a secret, fine if it's exposed to the public. good for runtime variables you need
    environment:
      - PORT=8000
      - MY_PROJECT=super awesome project

    # or can set more serious secrets as a file
    # enabling injecting secrets at runtime, even better to use GCP SecretsManager
    env_file:

    develop:

        # sync := add in a target where you want a local folder to one-directionally sync with the container
        # NOTE - doesn't sync any new folders or files created, only files that already exist. Would need to "rebuild"
